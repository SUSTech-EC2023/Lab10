Please implementing a simple Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm for solving a symbolic regression problme. The goal is to find an expression that approximates a given target function.

## Problem Description

The target function we aim to approximate is:
f(x) = x^2 + x + 1

The search space for candidate solutions consists of expressions built using the following basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition (`add`)
- Subtraction (`sub`)
- Multiplication (`mul`)
